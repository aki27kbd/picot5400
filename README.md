## Introduction
picot5400 is a micro controller (RP2040) and trackball sensor (PMW3360) module for mechanical keyboard. Module size is 2u x 2u (38mm x 38mm) so that it can be easily implemented with mechanical keyboard design. The picot5400 allows designers to quickly and easily implement a trackball keyboard with only key matrix circuit and PCB.

## Features
- On-board MCU (RP2040) allows a full functional firmware with a trackball, vial and RGB matrix
- High-performance sensor (PMW3360) up to 12,000 cpi
- USB connection flexibility - an on-board Type-C connector as well as a JST connector for Unified Daughterboards
- Sufficient GPIO pins available - 21 pins via 24-pin flexible flat cable and 7 pins via through holes.
- Bearing roller support with a smooth ball handling and easy assembly

## How to Use
